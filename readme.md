## Running the Demo

To start the demo, run the following commands in order:

1. Run `./env_setup.sh`
2. Run `roscore`
3. Run `rosrun cse571_project server.py -sub 1 -b 1`
4. Run `roslaunch cse571_project maze.launch`
5. Run `rosrun cse571_project move_tbot3.py`
6. Run `rosrun cse571_project random_walk.py`

#### action_server.py, server.py

Implements action execution and environment updation functions

#### environment_api.py

Implements an interface to communicate with the server and random_walk.py script

#### mazeGenerator.py

Environment generation script

#### move_tbot3.py, pid.py

Handles movement of turtlebot

#### books.json

Environment information dictionary generated by server.py

#### action_config.json

Lists all actions and their rewards, probabilities etc.
Format:

```
{
    "<action_name>": { 
            "function": "<function to execute inside action_server.py>",
            "params": [<list of parameters accepted by corresponding function in action_server.py (must be in same order)>],
            "success_reward": <reward if action succeeds>,
            "fail_reward": <reward if action fails>,
            "possibilities": {
                "<action_name>": <probability of execution>, #<action_name> corresponds to an action in the config
                "<action_name>": <probability of execution>,
                .
                .
            }
        },
        .
        .

```


Sample Action Config explanation:

```
{
    "pick": { 
        "function": "execute_pick",
        "params": ["book_name"],
        "success_reward": 25,
        "fail_reward": -25,
        "possibilities": {
            "pick": 0.85,
            "noaction": 0.15
        }
    },
```

The action name is defined as `pick`. It corresponds to the `execute_pick` function implemented in `action_server.py`. The function takes 1 variable parameter i.e. `book_name` defined in the `params` key. The reward for successful execution of this action is `25` and reward for a failed execution is `-25`. The given config defines a stochastic environment where executing this action `pick` can result in `pick` being executed with probability `0.85` or a no-op action (defined as `noaction`) with probability `0.15`

Note: To convert this to a deterministic action, we can change the probability of a `pick` action to `1`
