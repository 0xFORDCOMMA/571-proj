1) I have provided you four files.
2) 3 for APIs and  1 for search algorith.
3) In search algorithm file heapque contains 4 items in which the last item is for the list of states that robot has travelled till now.
4) you can run the command in following way to get the output.
 step1-> roscore
 step2-> rosrun search server.py -d 2 -n 2 -s 10
 step3-> rosrun search search_algorithm.py -a algorithm

5) I have kept a visited list in the algorithm right now but I can remove it. I will just have comment few lines in the code.
